In this project, I created a script that converts currency given the currency acronyms and amount. 
Please refer to the link below for to currency acronyms.

Please install this module.

 ```sh
python pip install requests
  ```
After installing, run the python file.

Enjoy!

I originally planned to also make a GUI to support the code, but I spent a lot more time on learning python than I thought I would. Prior C experienced helped, but I was not as experienced as I thought I was.
Citations/Sources are at the bottom of the code.
